        <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer
            who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely
            regarded as one of the best players in the world.
            Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win
            two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the
            latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in
            2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with
            Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA
            Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained
            a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth
            €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever. In France, Neymar won three league titles,
            three Coupe de France, and two Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1
            Player of the Year in his debut season. Neymar helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20
            season, and led the club to its first ever Champions League Final. </p>
