        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Lionel Andrés Messi also known as Leo Messi, (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains the Argentina national team. He is currently a free agent, having played all his professional career for La Liga club Barcelona, whom he captained from 2018 to 2021. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga and European league season (21) and the Copa América (17). He has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals ever by a player for a single club. In 2020, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings. </p>
